# StratagemMacro
The solution to the ableist Arrowhead Game Studios development choices. No idea why AH does not allow for keyboard macros. I've seen a TON of people complain about this, most of them are disabled in some way and literally cannot call in stratagems because of this horrid policy. It is 2024. Accessibility should be on the minds of all developers. Not very democratic of them...

Anyways, this works around that by simply emulating a dual shock 4 controller. Some of the stratagem codes might be wrong as I wrote this pretty quickly and I am simply too lazy to test all of them or even proofread it. Maybe you can do the same thing with AHK, i don't know.
